# Teacher Form Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Method Name Typo in Teacher_model.php
**Problem**: The method was named `insetTeacherFunction` instead of `insertTeacherFunction`
**Fix**: Corrected the method name in the model

### 2. Missing Edit Method in Admin Controller
**Problem**: The edit teacher functionality was not working because there was no edit method in the Admin controller
**Fix**: Added the edit method to handle teacher editing

### 3. File Upload Requirements
**Problem**: Both file upload fields were marked as required, causing form submission to fail when files weren't uploaded
**Fix**: Removed the required attribute from both file upload fields

### 4. File Upload Error Handling
**Problem**: The file upload code didn't check if files were actually uploaded before trying to move them
**Fix**: Added proper checks for file existence before attempting to move uploaded files

### 5. Database Column Issues
**Problem**: The new columns (aadhar_number, pan_number, family_id, ifsc_code) might not exist in the database
**Fix**: Created scripts to check and add missing columns

### 6. Error Handling
**Problem**: No proper error handling in the insertion process
**Fix**: Added try-catch blocks and proper error messages
