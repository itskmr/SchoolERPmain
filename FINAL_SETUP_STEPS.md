## üîß Required Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Update Script

- `teacher.pan_number` (VARCHAR 10)  
- `teacher.family_id` (VARCHAR 50)
- `bank.ifsc_code` (VARCHAR 11)

### Step 2: Test Database Structure (Optional)
Navigate to this URL to verify the database was updated correctly:
```
http://localhost:8080/test_teacher_data.php
```

This will show you if the new fields exist and are working.

### Step 3: Test Teacher Form
1. **Add New Teacher:**
   - Go to "Manage Employees" > "Teachers"
   - Click "ADD NEW TEACHER HERE"
   - Fill all required fields
   - Test the new fields (Aadhar, PAN, Family ID, IFSC Code)
   - Submit form - should redirect with success message

2. **Edit Existing Teacher:**
   - Click "Edit" on any teacher from the list
   - Verify all fields are editable and populated
   - Test saving changes
   - Check if new fields save and load correctly

3. **View Teacher Details:**
   - Click "View" on any teacher from the list
   - Verify all information displays correctly including:
     - Personal Information
     - Identity Information (Aadhar, PAN, Family ID)
     - Bank Account Details (including IFSC Code)
     - Social Media (if filled)
     - Documents (if uploaded)

### Step 4: Clean Up (After Testing)
Delete the temporary files:
- `update_database_web.php`
- `test_teacher_data.php`
- `FINAL_SETUP_STEPS.md` (this file)

## üîç Troubleshooting
